I wanted to make an NFT collection cause it seemed fun. So, why not create a collection around my ridiculous mug. Seriously, there are so many better things to have made a collection of but nah.

The Crypto Craig NFT colletion is 5013 unique randomly generated images that can be found on the **Polygon network**. I will be revealing them on my birthday, **_November 16, 2022 @ 10am MST_**. You can still puchase and it'll be like opening a present from me to you on my birthday!!

The NFT's won't just be amazing in your wallet or make an extrordinary collectable, it will also give you discounts to items in chicks Doodles and more!! How cool is that? So cool. Tell all your friends.

Let me get some of the most common questions out of the way.

**Is this a scam?**
: _It'd be a really bad one if it was. So, no._

**Is it a rug pull?**
: _I guess if you have expectations it could be but I should be good at setting the bar low. That said, I will commit to the roadmap._

**Will they go to the moon?**
: _No._

**Will they sell out?**
: _No._

**Why would you want one?**
: _No clue. Maybe cause I guilted you into getting some. Maybe cause you think your collection could use my face in it. Maybe cause you have a few extra MATIC and want to see what happens._

**Why on the polygon network?**
: _Cost!! I'm not made of Ethereum, yet._
